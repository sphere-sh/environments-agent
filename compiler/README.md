# Compiler

Compiles the sphere agent code into a binary format that can
be used by the linker to create a final executable.

## Compiler

The compiler is responsible for managing the compilation process. It is modeled as a state machine that transitions
between different states as it processes the input code.

## Lexer

The lexer is responsible for tokenizing the input code. It reads the input code character by character and generates
a stream of tokens that the parser can use to build the abstract syntax tree.

## Grammar

The grammar defines the syntax of the sphere agent code. It is used by the parser to build the abstract syntax tree.

## Parser

The parser is responsible for building the abstract syntax tree from the stream of tokens generated by the lexer. It
uses the grammar to guide the parsing process.

## Abstract Syntax Tree

The abstract syntax tree is a tree representation of the input code. It is used by the code generator to generate the
final binary code.

## Code Generator

The code generator is responsible for generating the final binary code from the abstract syntax tree. It uses the
abstract syntax tree to guide the code generation process.
